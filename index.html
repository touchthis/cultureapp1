Mainland Netherlands borders the North Sea to the north and west, Belgium to the south, and Germany to the east, and shares maritime borders[7] with Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. It is a parliamentary democracy organised as a unitary state. The country capital is Amsterdam and the seat of government is The Hague.[8] The Netherlands in its entirety is often referred to as Holland, although North and South Holland are actually only two of its twelve provinces. <a href="javascript:history.go(-1)" data-role="button">Go back</a> </div>

	      <h1>What about the Netherlands?</h1>
	      <p>If we explore the Dutch culture through   the lens of the 5-D Model, we can get a good overview of the deep   drivers of Dutch culture relative to other world cultures.<br>
	        <br>
	        <strong>Power distance</strong><br>
	        This   dimension deals with the fact that all individuals in societies are not   equal – it expresses the attitude of the culture towards these   inequalities amongst us. <br>
	        Power distance is defined as <em><strong>the   extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and   organisations within a country expect and accept that power is   distributed unequally</strong></em>.<br>
	        <br>
	        The Netherlands scores low on this dimension (score of 38) which means   that the following characterises the Dutch style: Being independent,   hierarchy for convenience only, equal rights, superiors accessible,   coaching leader, management facilitates and empowers. Power is   decentralized and managers count on the experience of their team   members. Employees expect to be consulted. Control is disliked and   attitude towards managers are informal and on first name basis.   Communication is direct and participative.<br>
	        <br>
	        <strong>Individualism</strong><br>
	        The fundamental issue addressed by this dimension is <em><strong>the degree of interdependence a society maintains among its members</strong></em>. It has to do with whether people´s self-image is defined in terms of &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rdquo;.<br>
	        In   Individualist societies people are supposed to look after themselves   and their direct family only. In Collectivist societies people belong to   &lsquo;in groups&rsquo; that take care of them in exchange for loyalty.<br>
	        <br>
	        The Netherlands, with a score of 80 is an Individualistic society. This   means there is a high preference for a loosely-knit social framework in   which individuals are expected to take care of themselves and their   immediate families only. In individualistic societies offence causes   guilt and a loss of self-esteem, the employer/employee relationship is a   contract based on mutual advantage, hiring and promotion decisions are   supposed to be based on merit only, management is the management of   individuals.<br>
	        <br>
	        <strong>Masculinity / Femininity</strong><br>
	        A   high score (masculine) on this dimension indicates that the society   will be driven by competition, achievement and success, with success   being defined by the winner / best in field – a value system that starts   in school and continues throughout organisational behaviour.<br>
	        A low   score (feminine) on the dimension means that the dominant values in   society are caring for others and quality of life. A feminine society is   one where quality of life is the sign of success and standing out from   the crowd is not admirable. <em><strong>The fundamental issue here is what motivates people, wanting to be the best (masculine) or liking what you do (feminine)</strong></em>.<br>
	        <br>
	        The Netherlands scores 14 on this dimension and is therefore a feminine   society. In feminine countries it is important to keep the life/work   balance and you make sure that all are included. An effective manager is   supportive to his/her people, and decision making is achieved through   involvement. Managers strive for consensus and people value equality,   solidarity and quality in their working lives. Conflicts are resolved by   compromise and negotiation and Dutch are known for their long   discussions until consensus has been reached. <br>
	        <br>
	        <strong>Uncertainty avoidance    </strong><br>
	        The   dimension Uncertainty Avoidance has to do with the way that a society   deals with the fact that the future can never be known: should we try to   control the future or just let it happen? This ambiguity brings with it   anxiety and different cultures have learnt to deal with this anxiety in   different ways.  <em><strong>The extent   to which the members of a culture feel threatened by ambiguous or   unknown situations and have created beliefs and institutions that try to   avoid these</strong></em> is reflected in the UAI score.<br>
	        <br>
	        The Netherlands scores 53 on this dimension and thus exhibits a   preference for avoiding uncertainty. Countries exhibiting high   uncertainty avoidence maintain rigid codes of belief and behaviour and   are intolerant of unorthodox behaviour and ideas. In these cultures   there is an emotional need for rules (even if the rules never seem to   work) time is money, people have an inner urge to be busy and work hard,   precision and punctuality are the norm, innovation may be resisted,   security is an important element in individual motivation.<br>
	        <br>
	        <strong>Long term orientation</strong><br>
	        The   long term orientation dimension is closely related to the teachings of   Confucius and can be interpreted as dealing with society&rsquo;s search for   virtue, <em><strong>the extent to which a   society shows a pragmatic future-oriented perspective rather than a   conventional historical short-term point of view</strong></em>.<br>
	        <br>
	        The Dutch score 44, making it a short term orientation culture.   Societies with a short-term orientation generally exhibit great respect   for traditions, a relatively small propensity to save, strong social   pressure to &ldquo;keep up with the Joneses&rdquo;, impatience for achieving quick   results, and a strong concern with establishing the Truth i.e.   normative. Western societies are typically found at the short-term end   of this dimension, as are the countries of the Middle East.</p><a href="javascript:history.go(-1)" data-role="button">Go back</a>
